# ExampleÂ 31-15. Catching StopIteration lets us get the value returned by averager

>>> coro_avg = averager()
>>> next(coro_avg)
>>> coro_avg.send(10)
>>> coro_avg.send(30)
>>> coro_avg.send(6.5)
>>> try:
...     coro_avg.send(None)
... except StopIteration as exc:
...     result = exc.value
...
>>> result
Result(count=3, average=15.5)
