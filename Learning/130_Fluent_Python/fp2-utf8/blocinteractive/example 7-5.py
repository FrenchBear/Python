# Example 7-5. Lists of factorials produced with map and filter compared to alternatives coded as list comprehensions

>>> list(map(factorial, range(6)))
[1, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120]
>>> [factorial(n) for n in range(6)]
[1, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120]
>>> list(map(factorial, filter(lambda n: n % 2, range(6))))
[1, 6, 120]
>>> [factorial(n) for n in range(6) if n % 2]
[1, 6, 120]
