# Example 31-10. Throwing DemoException into demo_exc_handling does not break it

>>> exc_coro = demo_exc_handling()
>>> next(exc_coro)
-> coroutine started
>>> exc_coro.send(11)
-> coroutine received: 11
>>> exc_coro.throw(DemoException)
*** DemoException handled. Continuing...
>>> getgeneratorstate(exc_coro)
'GEN_SUSPENDED'
