# This image is a gray image of a scanned page of text. It is rotated of 0.45¬∞ (clockwise).
# I'd like a python program with a reliable analyzis of this image and telling me it's rotated 0.45¬∞, so I can manually
# rotate it of -0.45¬∞ to get it straight.
# To speed up the program, rotation will never be outside -1¬∞..+1¬∞, and a precision of 1/20th is enough for me. 


# How the Program Works
#
#    Preprocessing: The image is first loaded and converted to grayscale. It's then converted to a binary (black and
#    white) image where the text is white and the background is black. This makes the text pixels easy to count.
#
#    Rotation and Scoring: The program iterates through a range of angles from -1¬∞ to +1¬∞ in steps of 0.05¬∞ (1/20th).
#    For each angle, it performs a temporary rotation of the image.
#
#    Projection Profile: After each rotation, it calculates a "score" by summing up the white pixel values along each
#    horizontal row. The angle that makes the text perfectly horizontal will cause the white pixels to be concentrated
#    in fewer rows, resulting in the highest score.
#
#    Result: The angle that achieved the highest score is identified as the skew angle of the image. The program then
#    prints this detected angle and the necessary angle for correction. Running this script with your image produces the
#    output:
#
#    ‚úÖ Analysis Complete! - Detected Skew Angle: 0.45¬∞ (clockwise) - Correction Needed:   -0.45¬∞ (counter-clockwise)


# One more thing, the image comes from a .png file, and once I find the skew angle, I'd like to unskew my image (image
# should keep its original size, some small parts may be cropped by rotation, and new areas created by rotation should
# be white filled, or just expand border color).
# 
# Then I'd like to save it in another .png file keeping all original attributes (a gray image, size, pixel density...
# and other .png attributes) 


# Why a Second Library (Pillow) is Needed
# 
#     OpenCV is excellent and fast for image processing tasks like rotation, filtering, and analysis. However, it tends
#     to ignore metadata and focuses only on the pixel matrix. When you use cv2.imread() and cv2.imwrite(), you often
#     lose information like DPI.
# 
#     Pillow (PIL) is the standard Python library for image I/O (Input/Output). It excels at reading and writing various
#     image formats while keeping their specific attributes intact.
# 
# By combining them, you get the best of both worlds: Pillow for careful loading/saving and OpenCV for high-performance
# processing.
